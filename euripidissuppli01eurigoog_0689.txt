V. 235. 'sta τὴν μὲν ἔσω 'aaut' tut γαίας, Ι ad δὲ πλευροκο-

transition from the feminine singular to the neuter plural, has
proved a stumbling·hlock to the transcribers and editors. Aldus
and most of the manuscripts read aiv τήν μὲν ἔσω, and τὰς dd
πλευροκοπῶν. The modern editions rond, from the emendation
