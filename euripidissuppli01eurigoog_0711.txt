Sophocles, ἀιίμσν the imperative of ἀτιμοῦν, which wc appre-
hend to be the true reading. · ’Λτιμάν is ssot an Assio verb,
although it occurs in Homer. histoad of ἀτιμοῦσι, which is
quoted from Xenophon (ee Rep. Aelim. 1, 14.) by Η. Stepha-
nus (m. L. (tm. p· 1554), Stephanus himself, in hie edi-
tion of-Xenophon, properly reads crinein from Stobacns. ht
the end of the seme treetise (3, 12), decederetis a manifest
error for ἦτίμωνιαι. ln httic prose, the verb ἀτιμοῦν never hes
any other signification tlsen that of inflicting the legal punish-
snent of hifasny, called ἀτιμία. 'l’he tragic poete sometimes con-
found ἀτιμοῦν with ἀτιμάζειν. So Aeeeh. Suppl· 651. odel μετ’

Robortellus end nse modern editors. Aldus and Turnebus read
ἀτιμάσαντες, which ferm does not enit the melre ιο well os
ἀτιμώσαντες in this passage, and hes been improperly substituted
ferit in other passages. ln s passage of Plato (Apol. δοται
Ρ·30. D.) quoted by H. Stephanus (sbi supro), the common
copies read ἀιιμάσειιν to tho injury of the sense, but the true
reading, ἀτιμώσειεν, is exhibited hy Stoheeus, and is juetly pre-
ferred hy forster. 0f the two following verses of Euripides,
we suspect that the former ought to be corrected from the lst-

ter: lph. A· 943. Θαυμαστὰ δ’ ἀς ἀνάξι’ ἤτιμασμίνη. Hel, 462.
Ὠ δαῖμον, ἀς ἀνάξι’ mendaeem· It isby uo means inemeteriel
to the present question to observo , that the words πατρὸς
ἀτίμωσιν are used by Aeschylus (choepls 488.) in a sense which
they could not bear, if ἀτιμῶσαι were incepeble of being used
instead cf clarusfons. ll what we have eeid , fails os satielying the4fi
render, that drinonis the true reading in the passage before us,
we heve something to urge in favour of ἀτιζι. This verb is ap-
l'iiifiiid‘ii ‘illidii 1ῗῖἀάἀῖἛοίὲἀῖἷὼὲιάἀὶίά
ρεσιν lotos» θίίάἀάἀι, νόμιμ’ linense θεάν. The hranueeripts
rond feruefacere· .The same variegy occure in the Alcestis,
where Aldus reads, v. 1040. Ocres σί ἀτιμάζων, osid' lv
ἀίσχροῖσι τιθείς. In the verse under corniderntion, we nsay
suppose ἀτιζι to have been corrupted into ἀτίμαζι byo cerclcss
transcribcr, and ἀτίμαζε to have been tnmed into ἀτίμα by a
diligent οιιο. lt ie to he hoped, that few of the readers of the
Muscam Criticnm erese ill versed incur art, as not to be ewnre,
how osten the common reading is two degrees removed from the
true reading. We mean no disrespect to lleisko, when we as-
sert, thet if he had found the following reading in his copy of
Sophocles, Μὴ νῦν ἀτίμαζε θεοὺς, θεοῖς σεσωσμένος, he would
have beon ot least as likely to propone ἀτίμα as ἀτιζε. Upon the

whole, however, we profer ἀτίμου.
