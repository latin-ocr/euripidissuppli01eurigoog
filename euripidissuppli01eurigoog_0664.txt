twsen the chonss 'and Amphitryon, would hare been no easy tnl,
aa long as the strophas and antistrophes were expected to be ola
certain length, and to bs erranged in'a certain order. Batitis
now discovered, theta single verse, or eren a single nord, ia
capable os making a complete strophe or snfishophe, and thet the
corresponding portione of the whole ode 'need not be dispendia
arry perceptiblo order. For the benefit os ouryoungerreaden,
wa will brielly describe the θοι-τηου process ol antisti-ophiratioa,
according to tbs most recent improvements. Tske a page ol l‘ls·
to, Demosthenes, or any other prose Greek author. l·' ind as ms·
ny pairs¹ of lines 'as you can, taking esre thathothlinesos tls
sarna pair bear seme resacrhlance to each other in the arrangement
olthelong andahait syllables. Suppose, lor instance, thats
faint resemblance subsiste between the fourth line and the four·
teenth, the lilth and the ninth, the serentis arrd the twenty-
l'ourth, the tenth and the eleventh, and so on. lmprore the re·
semblance hy altos-ing the text without scruple. Then intitle the
fourth line Strophe A, the iorrneenth AntistrepheA, the fifth
Strophe B, the ninth Antietrophe B, and so en. ll'hen you hare
antistrophiaed as much os the page aa you can, there will preba-
blv remain a considerable number ol linea which refuse all assi-
milatien or lellowship. Aa much of this brute matter as stands
at the topos the page before your first strophe, must be intitled
Προῳὸός. T owards the middle ol the page, ascries of refractory
syllables is called Μεσῳδός, and st the bettoni, 'Excidio You
are not restricted as to the number ol Μεσῳδοὶ, but the sewer ol
them that you exhibit, tha neater will your arrangement appear.
The use os antistrophes composed entirely of daches or asterisks,
203is an excellent expedient te prevent the too frequent recurrens
ol μεοῳδοί. The preceding rules, added to a little practice, nill
soon enable you to antistrophize any· dialogus oi Plato or any era-
tion os Demosthenes. Your task will be still easier, il you nte
in hand the writings of a poet. lt seldom happens, tha't a picen
is written with such studied and laborieus irregularity, that ,ιο
two verses exhibit the same kind of metre. The Greek tragedina,
in particular, employ so many dochmiac verses in their irregular
adea, that the metrical critic generally finds a great rrnrnherol

strophes and antistrophes ready prepared to his hand, which need
no alterationto make them tally with each other. ’
