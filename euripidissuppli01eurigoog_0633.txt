”cond instance ol a divided dactyl is lph. llul. 824. Oi ‚ πρίν ἄν
δείξω Aaronom πᾶσι ( Δαναοῖς ἅπασι Alo.) τᾶγχεχραμμίνα. 'l'he
eruo reading, tatto ys Δαναοῖς πᾶσι, which is oxhrlsilrd in ono
ota, and is mentioned with approbation by Mr. Person, has la-
tely been admitted into the text by Mr. Gaislord. Τίν’. suppres-

be correct, the conjunctior in the second verse mhst necessarilm
gpuexpmsged. tf we read td Πριάμου πεδίον, the dactyl will
ear.

· plocoroing to Mr. Person (p. iti), the poeta ol the soelr agree
with their brethren os the buskin, in excluding dactyle from tro-
chaic verses, except in the case of proper names. lntheelevelt
comedics os Aristophanes, we have not discovered arsy genuino
instance οί a dactyl in a verso ol this measure. We have obaeved,
however, three verses, which appear to deserve greater atten-
tion than tbep have received. ach. 220. Καί παίνιηῑνΛαιτρατί
sd οιίίος βᾶρυντται. Eq· 327. Προῖτος aisn· d δ’Ἵπποίίιριου lt
βεται θεώμενος. Poc- 1154. Μυρρίίνας αίτηοον l} Αἰσχινάδου τοῖν
καρπίμων. lt is almost superfluous to observo, that the two thid-¹
dle syllables οί these three proper names are necessarily short.-
Ἱππόδαμος, in particular, caranot reasonably be supposed· to be
a lloric eornpound of innoc end δῆμος. We porceive, therefore,
that in order to introduce these redactory names into tetrameter
-sroehaioa , Aristophanes has twice used a choriambus, and once
an ionic o minore, in the ploce ol the regular trochaic dipodin-
'l‘he following instance· οί the nse ot dactyle, to which we ore
unable to make any additions, are givenby hir. Porsen (pss-22
Hennippns opud Athen. p. 486. A. Ἢν ίχυί πόθον τι τήνδε την
λεπαστὴν ἔκπιον, Τῳ Διονυοῳ παντα repertor δίδωμι χρήματα.
We should be very happy, ilwe were able to rid ourselves ol this
dactyl as easily as of that which follows: Comicae incertas apud
Plator-ola. Polio. Praeceps. p. 811. Ιί. Μητίοχος μὲν γὰρ στρατηγεῖ,
Μητίοχος dl “ii idolio, Μητίοχος d’ ίίρτους ίποπτςῖ (l. ίποπιιῖ),
Μητίοχος δὲ tolosae, Μητιόχη) dl niveo κεῖται, Μητίοχος d' οί·
peltam, We vehemently suspect, that this importent personage,
who appears, from Plutarch, to have been a creature ol' Pericles,
was not called nonanus, but hletichns. ll the reader will con-
sult Alberti’s note on the words Μητίχου vipereo in llesychius,

he will be conunocd thet our conjecture is nottlestitute οί tow.
