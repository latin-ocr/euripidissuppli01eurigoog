ses are giren to tho Ἀργεῖος. We believe rightly: bnt we also -
believe, that s verso iswanting‚ which ought to bo inurpont
between them, and to ba given to Adrastus. Oi tho two orto·i

Markland in his notos, and Mr. Gaissord in the text of the preo-
ont edition, aesign both these verses to tho· ldeseenger. ‘lt
could hardly have occurred to Adrastus,’ says Markland, ‘u
uk whether Theseus himself had washed the wounds of tho dt·
ad bodies) We apprehensi that the next preceding question ul
Adrastus, which we suppose to he lost, would make every
thing clear, if it were preserved.

V. 882. Παῖς oio, drdlpno’ εὔθῦς crisseio ἦθονᾶς Meam
τραπέσθαι, πρός sci μαλθακὸν βίον. One MS. reads βίον. Set
0¹¹1 observatim 0¹1 V· 8⁷. Markland mentions, although not Ϊ
with approbation, the emendation of lleiske, πρός τε μαλθακὰ
βίον. There cen be little doubt, we think, that tho poet wrote
esui ιθ guldensis βίον, and that the present reading is formed
from καὶπρὸς cognituris βίους every natural corruption oi
the original reading. Tho propensity of transcribere to add tht
propositione without necessity, and also to omit the wrong
word in verses which have more than the proper number-of
syllables, is well known.

which reading is also exhibited by Stobaeus, Tit. cr. p. 562.

correct. lll- v· ⁶86· Κᾶμοὶ τάδ’ ἦν πρόρρητα, ,καὶ τοιαῦτ’ ἔ·
