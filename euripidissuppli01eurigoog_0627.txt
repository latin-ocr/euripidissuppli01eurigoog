'l'he lines ol Aeschylus quoted in this antedilurian passage,
ue commonly read ss lollows: Ἕκατοντακᾶρηνον πρὸς plangat-66
ηοῦμινον, lundon θοῦρον, adom ὃς deuiam θεοῖς. According
so Bnmck, in his note on ulzffi. ln priori scribere potuisset

ἲτα ἑκατοννᾶρηνον vel ἕκατοννᾶκρανονο in altero κρῖν’ pro πᾶσιν.

reading ἓνοτοντᾶκρανον receives some support from a sisniler
variation in Eurip. llere. 611. Rumpis εἰς φῶς τὸν τρίκρανον
ζμρον. The editions srorn Aldus 1ο Bornes inclmire read spesd-
ffpo. But the Attics always wrote ἕνατοντᾶλαντος, lausdunum,

ὁζνγος, lauriacum, etc, without the additional spilsble.

e Glasgow edition ol Aeschylus reads ἓνοτογνᾶρηνον, which
'ffinlllomlield hee properly altered to ἑκατογκάρανον. lnhlr Blonr-
gielde edition, the following verse is thus represented: lhpeiru
ἓᾮοῦρον, ὅστις durium θεοῖς.

[a. As our limite will not allow us to produce all the instances
'ol' nnlswsul anapeets which aro to be found in the commonedi-
lions of the tragedias, we shall content ourselves with laying be-
fore our readers those wluch occur in Brunck’s edition of Sopho·

Brunck is a strenuous defendor oi anapests, which he seems to
