” We beg pardon dl our readers sor entertaining them with
these looleries, and we solsmnly essene them, thot the process
abore described con hardly be called a caricature of the manner
in which hlr. liennann hoa treated several parta oi the play before
us. 'that portion of it, sor instance, which we have already
mentioned, and which in Barnes’s edition ynalres serenty-one lines
(vv. roro-1086.) , is divided by Mr. llnmann into eleven stro-
phas , and aa many antistrophea, with &asendic ol eleven lines,
a μισῳὸὁς ol one, and' three trimeter iambica. The peopdde,
which bys slip ol the editor’s penis intilledisspdde, isalso a
trimeter iambic. Eidoatoe invoa decedo innodaris φόνου, which is
closely connected by the sense wilh tha preceding words. Tho
antistrophes are interspersed among the strophas without any uae-
thod or order. That the render may judge lor himself, we sub-
join tha arrangement, denoting the strophas by the capital nu7
merula, and the corresponding sittistrophes by the small nume·
ratsosrhe Greek alphabet„ A, c, Β, Γ, Δ, Ε, F, Z, fl, θ,
Β. 1, e, M, so, ζ, e, sy, β, ς, e, d. Those who wish to
ow more ol this system ol antistrophization, will do well in
consulting Mr. Hermann's preiace, which contains e considerable
number oi rules and observatione respecting it, together with

some other metrical subtilties, which on the present occasion we
ohecrsully pass over in silence.

Perhaps it may be necessary to inlonn some of our readers,

tlrat in the year 1794, aselection oi Greek tragedias, in which
the Hercules Furens was included, was edited hythe learned
Gilbert Wakefield. -llelicient as blr. Wakelielsl iras in some of the
qualities os a critic, particularly judgment, taste, and accuracy5
his annotatione on the six plays contained inhia Tragoediam
Deiectus, are not destitute ol value, ond ought not to be nephe-204
ted either by editors or hy reviewers ol editione. 0ur acquain-
tance with his critical writings was so exceedingly slight, that
when the present occasion compelled u's to examine his notes on
the llercules Furens with considerable attention, the peculiarities
oi his manner made ι more lively impression on our minda, than
will readily be understood by those scholare, to whom long and
intimate acquaintance lass rendered his stile ol criticism familiar.
0n looking ouer the remarks on particular passages ol this tra·
gedy, which we are about to submitto the consideration ol our
readers, and which were mostly written heloro these prelinrinary
peges, we observe that in inore then one instance we have almost
inseneihly deviated froin our natural course, and have inserted
observatione which would lind amore proper place in a resiew oi
hir. Wakefield’s Tragoediorum Delectata, than in the present ar-

u‘cle. Aa, however, astrict adherente tothe innodiste subject
